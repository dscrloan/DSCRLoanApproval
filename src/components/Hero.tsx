        </h1>
        <div className="mb-8 space-y-4">
          <p>
            DSCR loan approval hinges on your investment property's ability to generate sufficient rental income to cover its debt service payments. Lenders evaluate your debt service coverage ratio alongside loan-to-value ratios, cash reserves, credit profile, and property characteristics to determine DSCR loan approval and terms.

            Understanding these key DSCR approval factors empowers real estate investors to position their rental property loan applications strategically. Working with qualified lending professionals can help align your specific investment scenario with DSCR lender requirements to maximize your approval odds.
