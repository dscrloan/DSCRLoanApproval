                Most lenders view SFR properties as standard DSCR applications with typical 1.0-1.25 minimum ratios. These properties often qualify for the most competitive terms due to their stable rental income patterns and broad market appeal.

                Multi-unit properties generally receive similar treatment to SFR but may require slightly higher DSCR minimums (1.15-1.30) due to increased management complexity. Multiple income streams can actually strengthen approval odds when properly documented.

                Condo investments face additional scrutiny around warrantability, HOA financial health, and owner-occupancy ratios. Some lenders require pre-approval of condo projects, which can limit your options but doesn't eliminate DSCR financing opportunities.

              <p>
                STR properties typically require higher DSCR minimums (1.30+) and more substantial reserves due to income volatility and seasonal fluctuations. Lenders may use conservative income calculations or require market rent analysis rather than STR projections.
